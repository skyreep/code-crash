## Future Work
While the load time is fine on desktop browsers, the title background image has a long load time on mobile. I tried using a smaller image, and looked into the WebP image format, but unfortunately, it was not compatible with all mobile browsers in my testing. In the future I would like to decrease the load time further. I would also like to make the testmonial carousel a fixed height so that its dimensions aren't altered as it changes slides due to varying text length.
