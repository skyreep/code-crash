## Usage

## Future Work
While the load time is fine on desktop browsers, the main background image has a long load time on mobile. I tried using a smaller image, and looked into the webpg image format, but unfortunately it was not compatible with all mobile browsers in my testing. In the future I would like to decrease the load time further.
